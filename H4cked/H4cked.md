# Welcome to my "H4cked" CTF walkthorugh üíª!
You can find this CTF and many more on https://tryhackme.com/

## Self note:
In order to make this walkthrough as practicall as possible,
I added only the relevant pictures and explenations, in order to make it straightforward.

## Questions 1&2‚ùì

On the first question you should only read the task ‚úÖ
<br>
In the second question we asked to find which service the attacker tried to attack,
<br>
So let's open the ".pcap" file we got:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/1.png">
<br><br>

A little brief and we can see the service has been attacked by the hacker,
<br>
And the answer for the second task is "FTP" ‚úÖ
<br>

## Question 3‚ùì

On the third question we asked to find the tool which used by the hacker,
<br>
Google it!
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/2.png">
<br><br>

The answer for the third task is "Hydra" ‚úÖ

## Questions 4&5‚ùì

Now they asked us to find which user the hacker tried to hack and what is the password.
<br>
Take a look at the .pcap file again:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/3.png">
<br><br>

As we can see the username is "jenny" and now we can answer question number 4 ‚úÖ
<br>
But what is the password?, in order to find the password let's take another brief and follow the TCP stream:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/4.png">
<br><br>

It can take a while but for experienced users it can take up to 2 minutes so take it easy.
And we can answer the fifth question (password123) ‚úÖ

## Questions 6&7‚ùì

On question 6 we asked to find the current FTP working directory,
<br>
Again, follow the TCP stream on the further part of the .pcap file:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/5.png">
<br><br>

As you can see, the current working directory is "/var/www/html" and now you can answer question number 6 ‚úÖ
<br>
In addition you can see the answer for question number 7, the backdoor's name is "shell.php" ‚úÖ
<br>

## Question 8‚ùì

In order to answer question number 8, I sorted the packets from the biggest to the smallest,
<br>
I knew that the shell should be bigget than the other packets and found it in the first place,
<br>
and then examined it:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/6.png">
<br><br>

You can see within the file, that there is a link to the creator's website and this is the answer:
<br>
"http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell", now answer question number 8 ‚úÖ

## Questions 9-14‚ùì

Ok, now we know that the attacker uploaded a webshell, and we have to try and find when he executet it,
<br>
so find the correct place (about the buttom of the .pcap file when there are a lot of TCP packets),
<br>
and follow the TCP stream, that reveals us a lot of answers:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/7.png">
<br><br>

First, you can see the first command the attacker executed after getting his reverse shell "whoami",
<br>
and now answer question number 9 ‚úÖ
<br><br>
In addition the host name "wir3" and the TTY command "python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'",
<br>
Now answer question number 10 and 11 ‚úÖ
<br><br>

When you trying to scroll a little, you will notice the answers for questions 12 and 13:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/8.png">
<br><br>

In order to get a root shell, the attacker simply executed "sudo su", then he uploaded a malucious file called "Reptile",
<br>
this file is a backdoor type that called "Rootkit", this is type of a backdoor that very hard to detect and can hide itself
<br>
in order to keep itself on the system and stay undetected.
<br><br>

So, the answers are:
<br>
12: "sudo su" ‚úÖ
<br>
13: "Reptile" ‚úÖ
<br>
14: "Rootkit" ‚úÖ
<br><br>

## Questions 15&16‚ùì

On task 15 we just have to read what they have to say about the attacker ‚úÖ
<br>
But on task 16 we have to run a brute force attack with "Hydra" on the FTP service in order to gain access to the machine.
<br>
Easy...
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/9.png">
<br><br>

So I knew the username is "jenny" but the attacker changed his password...
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/10.png">
<br><br>

Now we also know the password and can answer question number 16 ‚úÖ
<br>

## Question 17‚ùì

Now we have access to the FTP server, and that means we can add a shell or edit the current shell,
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/11.png">
<br><br>

So I used the same webshell (copied from pentest monkey's github), and just changed the relevand variables:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/12.png">
<br><br>

Then I uploaded the shell to the FTP server:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/13.png">
<br><br>

But don't forget to change the permissions, otherwise, the webshell won't work!
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/14.png">
<br><br>

In addition, don't forget to check question number 17! ‚úÖ

## Questions 18-20‚ùì

Simply set up a listener on the same port you wrote on the .php webshell, and search the file in the browser:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/15.png">
<br><br>

Now we can also check question number 18! ‚úÖ
<br><br>

The last two questions is about becoming a Root and read the flag, but this is the easiest part, because:
<br>
1. Maybe we are "www-data" but we know about the user "jenny".
<br>
2. We know jenny's password, it is the same password for the FTP server.
<br>
3. We know that jenny has sudo permissions for all of the commands(Including "sudo su")!
<br><br>

<br><br>

So, we answered questions 19 and 20 and finished the CTF!
<br>
Hope you enjoyed and maybe learned something new!
