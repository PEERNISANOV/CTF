# Welcome to my "Year of the Rabbit" CTF walkthorugh üê∞!
You can find this CTF and many more on https://tryhackme.com/

## Self note:
In order to make this walkthrough as practicall as possible,
I added only the relevant pictures and explenations, in order to make it straightforward.

## Reconnaissanceüîç:
First of all, I run Nmap scan in order to check for open ports.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/1.png">
<br><br><br>

As we can see, we have 3 different ports.
<br>
21: FTP
<br>
22: SSH
<br>
80: HTTP server
<br><br>
So I first checked the HTTP server.
<br>
But there is nothing there, the service is running, and the index.html is the default apache banner.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/2.png">
<br><br><br>

But if the apache is on, so probably there is a folder, so I treid to enumeratre it with GoBuster.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/3.png">
<br><br><br>

And as we can see, there is a folder called "/assets", so I've navigated there.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/4.png">
<br><br><br>

This page listed me two files, one is kind of rabbit hole, and the other is a stylesheet.
<br>
At this point I was stucked, but after couple minutes I've noticed two things:
<br>
1: There is a voice message within the .mp4 file, that says something like "this video is a rabbit hole (burp) you are looking in the wrong place".
2: In the stylesheet, there is a comment as you can see below:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/5.png">
<br><br><br>

Intresting, let's navigate there.
<br>
In this page there is a message that tells us to turn off the JavaScript, so I did so,
<br>
(otherwise the page will redirect you automatically to a youtube video).
<br>
And inside the page, there was the same video from "/assets", with the same burp üòÜ,
<br>
So I understood that I might need to use Burp Suite.
<br><br>

## Traffic Interceptionüõë:

After I've intercepted the traffic I noticed this:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/6.png">
<br><br><br>

There is a hidden directory within the request, so I checked it.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/7.png">
<br><br><br>

## Hidden contentü¶ñ:
When I've seen this I immediately understood that this is a steg file (a file that have hidden files within),
<br>
In the picture I used "strings", strings is a Linux command to check the strings within a file.
<br><br>
I want to help you further and list you two different ways to analyse such file:
<br>
1: strings <file>
<br>
2: binwalk -e <file>
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/8.png">
<br><br><br>

At some point, I've noticed a message "Username is ftpuser, One of these is the password:".
<br>
So I made a "ftppass.txt" with all of the passwords under this message.
<br><br>

## Brute-Forcing FTPüîì

I used the "ftppass.txt" with the username "ftpuser" and let hydra to do the job.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/9.png">
<br><br><br>

Hydra found the password (although I didn't took a screenshot of the passüòÜ) and I've logged in to the FTP service.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/10.png">
<br><br><br>
Apart from the "Eli's_Creds.txt", there is nothing intresting there, (but now we know one of the user's name).
<br>
I used cat on this file and:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/11.png">
<br><br><br>

I tried CyberChef but it's not recognised this encoding method.
<br>
But after a little search I've found that this endoing method called "BrainF*ck".
<br>
So I've searched for decoder and the username and the password actually was there.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/12.png">
<br><br><br>

## Get a shellüêö

After I had the username and the password, I tried to log in the SSH service,
<br>
When I managed to do so, I noticed a login message (also called "motd", stands for "message of the day"),
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/13.png">
<br><br><br>
Root tells Gwendoline about a secret place (probably a directory), At first I didn't pay attention to the message.
<br>
Then I found in the /home a user called gwendoline with the "user.txt" inside.
<br>
Guess what? I didn't had the permission to read the file.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/14.png">
<br><br><br>

## Lateral Movementüß≠:

After a while, I decided to search for the "s3cr3t" place root told gwenldoline about, (I preffer to first take a look on the maching by myself),
<br>
and I run a search:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/15.png">
<br><br><br>

Root told Gwendoline that his password is awful and also disclosed his password.
<br>
I don't care about the the irresponsibility of Root and managed to log in Gwendoline user:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/16.png">
<br><br><br>

First I returned to the flag again and paste it in the Try Hack Me's website.
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/17.png">
<br><br><br>

We have found the first key!üîë
<br><br>

## Privilege Escalationüëë:

After all, we want to be root and not a regular user,
<br>
So I made this short, but I'll explain you this stages step by step:
<br><br>
<img align="center" src="Images/19.png">
<br><br><br>

I've divided the picture to four different squeres, one after one:
<br><br>
1: I run the command "sudo -l", in order to check if my user can run any kind of command with sudo.
<br>
As you can see we have a different kind of the section "(ALL, !root)", you might seen something like "(ALL, ALL)"
<br>
That means my user <b>can</b> run the command as another user, but not as root.
<br>
We can bypass this filter, This filter works with the indexing of users, for example in the /etc/passwd you can see the user id,
<br>
and as we know, the root's id is 0.
<br><br>
2: In this section I run the command with the id of a -1 user, now you probably think how it is even possible?
<br>
So let me tell you something, it's not.
<br>
However, when I tried to run it as the -1 user the system tryied to change the value of the user to 0 because this is what happening when
<br>
the system trying to do so.
<br><br>

3: When I run the command, I provided with the vim interface, so I checed who am I with the ":!whoami".
<br>
As you can see, this command returned me that I am root.
<br>
Then I pressed enter in order to insert another command, so I wrote ":!/bin/bash".
<br><br>

4: In the last section, I made sort of a PoC in order to show you that I am root, and then I've checked the content of "/root/root.txt".
<br><br>

## Thank you for reading my walkthrough!
